# Diabetes-Prediction


Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on three features: Glucose, Age, and Diabetes (target variable). We use three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest to perform the predictions and compare their performance.

Dataset
The dataset (diabetes.csv) contains three columns:

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration.
Age: Age of the patient.
Diabetes: Outcome variable indicating if the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

Models
1. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

2. Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

3. Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to obtain a more accurate and stable prediction.
